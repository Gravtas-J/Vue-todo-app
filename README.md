### 1. Introduction

In this documentation, I'll walk you through my Vue.js To-do List App. I created this app as a basic introduction to Vue.js, offering functionalities to add, view, and delete daily tasks.

### 2. Installation Guide

**What you'll need:** 
- Node.js and npm. If you don't have them, you can grab them from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/).

**How to set it up:**

1. First, either clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Once that's done, open your terminal and navigate to where the project is located:
```bash
cd path/to/my/todo-app
```
3. Install all the necessary dependencies using:
```bash
npm install
```
If you're a Yarn fan like some out there:
```bash
yarn install
```

### 3. Features I've Implemented

- **Add Tasks**: I've added an input field where you can type in a new task. Once you submit, it'll be added to your list.
- **View Tasks**: I've designed it so that all tasks are visible in a list, making it easy to see everything at a glance.
- **Delete Tasks**: Every task comes with a little delete button, so when you've completed something, you can easily remove it.

### 4. How to Run the App

1. Make sure you're in the main directory of the project.
2. To start the app, use:
```bash
npm run serve
```
Or, if you're using Yarn:
```bash
yarn serve
```
3. Once it's running, open up your browser and go to `http://localhost:8080/` to see the app in action.
4. When you're done and want to shut things down, just hit `Ctrl + C` in the terminal.

**Thinking about some stuff to do next:**
- Saving tasks so they're still there even if you close the app.
- Adding a way to edit tasks.
- Maybe even categorizing tasks or marking them as "done" instead of deleting them.

Thanks for checking out my project! I hope you find it as useful and educational as I did while creating it.
